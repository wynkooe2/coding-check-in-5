<h2>Recipes</h2>

  <p>You can make exactly as good cakes, pies, cookies, and candies by
      substituting for the butter named in your recipes 3/4 the
      quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. On this and the
      following pages are a few recipes in which this substitution has
      been made. Try them. You will find them good and more economical
      than when made with butter.</p>

  <p>You may have some favorite recipes that are too expensive on account
      of the large amount of butter required. You can reduce their cost
      by using Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.</p>
